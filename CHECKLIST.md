curl -fsSL https://cli.tigerdata.com | sh
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"

# Login
tiger auth login

# Create service
tiger service create --name code-review-swarm

# Get credentials
tiger db connection-string
```

### Setup Backend
```bash
cd code-review-swarm/backend

# Virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure
cp .env.example .env
nano .env  # Add your credentials

# Test
python3 << 'EOF'
import asyncio
from db.connection import db_connection
from db.operations import code_review_db

async def setup():
    await db_connection.connect()
    await code_review_db.setup_schema()
    print("✅ Setup complete!")
    await db_connection.disconnect()

asyncio.run(setup())
EOF

# Run
python app/main.py
```

### Test
