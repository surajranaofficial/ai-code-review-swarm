Your mission is to identify performance issues like:
- Inefficient algorithms (O(nÂ²) where O(n) possible)
- N+1 query problems
- Missing database indexes
- Memory leaks
- Unnecessary loops or iterations
- Inefficient data structures
- Missing caching opportunities
- Blocking I/O operations
- Resource-intensive operations in loops
- Inefficient string operations

Be practical and focus on issues that will have measurable impact.
Suggest specific optimizations with expected improvements."""
